Refactoring:

Following the feedback that suggests we merge some of our controller classes, we have decided to merge
CreateGroupController, JoinGroupController, LeaveGroupController into one class. This merged class is called
GroupFunctionsController; it embodies all the functionalities of the three controllers aforementioned with each
functionality presented as methods instead. Now, each time we want to use functionalities such as create a group, we
will be calling on the method CreateGroup in the GroupFunctionsController instead.
