After running the program, you will start with the page where you can create or log in to an existed account
When our program is opened for the first time, the option to create an account is chosen, you then have to choose a
userid (which should be unique in the system) along with a password. Afterward, you can now log in to the created
account.

For every user who logs in to an account, they would next have the access to group page and task page.
In the group page, user can interact with other users by creating a group for other users to join by typing in the group
name to the join group option. If a user is in a group, they also have the option to leave it by typing in the name of
the group they joined to the leave group option. When the creator of a group leave, the group will be dismissed.
Last but not least, as any productivity app, the user is able to create task and mark the task finished in the task
page. Also, all of the unfinished tasks would be displayed on the task page. Upon finishing a task, they can then
mark it finished by choosing its sequence number showed in the task page.
