The User first opens the app and creates an account with a username and password. Then after the User logs in with the
account he just created, he can either go to the Group page or add a task in the Task page. In the Group page, the user
can either create a group or join an existing group. Also, he can leave the group after having joined a group. In the
task page, the user can add tasks, view the tasks and check the task if it is completed.

When the user creates a new account, the method createUser() is called within the UserManager class. An instance of the
class User is instantiated with the required attributes (username and password) and stored in UserManager.

When the user creates a group or joins a group by a string groupName, GroupManager will be called, and if group is
newly created, GroupManager will record that group in a hashmap using its name as key, also, UserManager will be called
and update group lists in user’s account. After that, the User can choose whether or not to leave a group: If User
leaves the group he created, the group will be dismissed and every member in that group will leave the group
automatically, that is, GroupManager will be called to delete the whole group from the record and UserManager will make
sure that group is removed from each member’s list. If the User didn’t create the group he wants to leave, only he will
be removed from the group's member list and his group list will also be updated by UserManager.

Last but not least, when the user gets into the Task page, he will see unfinished tasks displayed on the interface and
the first option is he can add a new task into it, which will call UserManager to put a new task into the user's task
list. And the second option for users is to mark a task completed shown on the interface by its index, which will make
the task disappear from the interface.
