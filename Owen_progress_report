Writing: Responsible for writing the Code style and documentation in design document
    and presentation

Coding: Added a new alarm clock feature to the program, now that the user can choose to create a task with
    a specified due date, and then when the due date comes, the program will alert the user in
    forms of a pop up window notifying the user that the task is due.
    - Alarm, AlarmMenu, AlarmStarter, TaskWithDueDate
        Added the notification system for managing the alarm system mentioned above, responsible
    for setting up a notification page that displays the user's mailbox, where a message will be sent
    to here along with the pop up window. User can view notification and delete notification
    - NotificationPageController, NotificationManager
        Modified other controller and use case class in order to integrate the new features and design.
    And cleared all the warnings and fixed existing bugs.
