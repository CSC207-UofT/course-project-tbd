                              Pulled GUImain out then refactored .fxml files into one fold in GUI package.
                              Then I manually changed .fxml address in controllers that didn't get refactored

Kevin: - Writer of SOLID principles explanation .
       - Implemented AnnouncementPageController, ViewFolderController, other controllers etc.
       - Worked on our controllers to meet the changes suggested by TA including any coding principle violations.

       Phase 2 expectation:
       Help finish the GUI of all the group related controllers
       Fix bugs

       Phase 2:
       - Was responsible for working on GUI for task management
            - Created several controllers and presenters for the GUI such as the AnnouncementPage, ViewGroups and
            other controllers related to group.
            - Fixed up old bugs and code smells.


       - Developed and worked on Admin system with Aryan
            - Implemented the AdminAccess controller.
            - Fixed bugs that arose when trying to access other accounts and a bug that prevented buttons from loading.

       - Improved the design document by adding new stuff for SOLID and design patterns.

       Github Pull requests -
       - Worked on the announcement page controller and ViewGroupController. Learnt a lot about SceneBuilder and
       creating GUI. Learnt how JavaFX and xml works. Also learnt about dynamically creating elements during runtime
       instead of statically programming buttons etc.
            - https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-tbd/pull/101

       - Merged the main branch with ours to keep everything up to date and resolved conflicts when they arose. Worked
       and implemented the admin feature to our account which allows access to all other user accounts in our system.
       Enabled us to test and work on issues easily.
       (Note that admin access was worked directly on main hence the merge)

Peter: - Refactored some classes, i.e. merged CreateGroupController, JoinGroupController, and LeaveGroupController.
       - Made changes to User class and UserGroupManager class.
       - Added docstrings to all the presenter classes.
       - Added docstrings to all of the GUI controller classes.
       - Created tests for class UserGroupManager
       - Helped in finishing the CRC cards.
       - Removed and cleaned up warnings in the classes
       - Finished UserPageController Gui. JoinGroupControllerGUI, CreateGroupControllerGui
       
       Phase 2 expectation:
       Finish GUI for UserPage, JoinGroupPage, CreateGroupPage controllers
       Fix bugs

       Github Pull requests -
       - Finished the CreateGroupController + presenter, JoinGroupController + presenter, UserPage Controller
         presenter. This pull request is significant because these controllers and presenters laid the foundations
         for the CreateGroupControllerGUI and the JoinGroupControllerGUI; these controllers and their presenters helped
         give us an idea on how the finished GUI would function. Basically, these controllers are the precursors of
         their respective GUIs in the final project.

Owen: - Writer of the Code Style and Documentation explanation
      - Implemented Alarm, AlarmMenu, AlarmStarter, TaskWithDueDate to implement an Alarm Clock feature
      - Implemented NotificationPageController, NotificationManager
      - Fixed all the warnings and existing bugs.

      Phase 2 expectation:
      Help finish the GUI for some of the controllers
      Fix bugs

      Phase 2:
      - Was responsible for implementing part of the GUI for our program
        - Notification Page
        - Warning pop up window
        - Add, view, and finish task controller
        - connected task and notification page to make sure everything is in sync and works as intended
      - took a lot of time to fix bugs in GUI such as how to make data preserved going from stages to stages, and
        scene to scenes. NullPointerException was the most common bug to fix and the most annoying
      - added test for Alarms system and notification page

      Github Pull request:
      - Implemented the Alarm and notification system, first time working with threads and Time and timer packages
        in java, did a lot of research and spent a lot of time, but it worked at last and it was worth it. The alarm
        system became one of the signature feature in our program.
        - https://github.com/CSC207-UofT/course-project-tbd/pull/30

      - Helped implementing add, view, and finish task controller to work with the alarm and notification system. It was
        during this pull request I got a deep and clear understanding of how javafx works and utilized debugging
        features to figure out how to keep data preserved throughout different scenes. This is important because it
        completes one of the essential features in our productivity app.
