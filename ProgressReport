Phase 0 summary:

        2. Discussion board, where each members of the group can post stuff
        3. private message: each member can leave a message to others in this group to Notification Box (will show up in
        phase 1.
        4. Group can store some data in different "Category", which is like a folder with different names
        5. Leader may receive a notification whenever an user applied the group. And he can choose to accept this new
        member or reject him.

    Task:

        have extended functionality differed from normal task
        - CountDownTask will implement a tomatoClock template to count down the time when the user choose this task
