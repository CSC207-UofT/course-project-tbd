      Phase 2:
      - Was responsible for implementing part of the GUI for our program
        - Notification Page
        - Warning pop up window
        - Add, view, and finish task controller
        - connected task and notification page to make sure everything is in sync and works as intended
      - took a lot of time to fix bugs in GUI such as how to make data preserved going from stages to stages, and
        scene to scenes. NullPointerException was the most common bug to fix and the most annoying
      - added test for Alarms system and notification page

      Github Pull request:
      - Implemented the Alarm and notification system, first time working with threads and Time and timer packages
        in java, did a lot of research and spent a lot of time, but it worked at last and it was worth it. The alarm
        system became one of the signature feature in our program.

      - Helped implementing add, view, and finish task controller to work with the alarm and notification system. It was
        during this pull request I got a deep and clear understanding of how javafx works and utilized debugging
        features to figure out how to keep data preserved throughout different scenes. This is important because it
        completes one of the essential features in our productivity app.
