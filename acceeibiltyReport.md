Accessibility report from group TBD

1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-5 sentences or point form notes explaining which features your 
program adhere to that principle.


    Principle 1: Equitable Use

    This productivity app aims for providing equal experiences for all users. Everyone in our app can make their own 
    group, make plans, and interact with others in group system. That is, all users share same functionalities no matter
    who they are, and there is no reward system for people with better skills.
    
    The exception is Admin user, who is responsible to monitor users, since even though admin account cannot created by 
    normal users, but it has power to violate users' privacy a little bit. So in the future, we will only allow admin 
    account read user's public infomation and have a message box for answering users' questions.



    Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
    In our app, your will see tips to guide people to save time and make full use of our app in their life. Also, he 
    location of visual elements on the screen are perfectly designed, and we have hyperlinks if the button cannot show
    enough infomation to gudie users. 
    
    Our app has not been transformed into Android app yet. In the future, we can learn how to do it and try our best to
    make sure  our app can run on every platform.



    Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use

    We have lebels to remind users when they make mistakes. For example, when user type in wrong password, the system 
    will notify users to retype again or reset password with security answer. 

    However, one thing we didn't do well is that in some parts of our program. User have to refresh the screen to see
    the infomation. That is due to the fact that our group member just learnt javaFX after phase 1, and if we have more
    time, we would change that, and make the screen update immediately without refreshing the screen.


    
    Principle 4: Perceptible Information

    In our app, the essential information such as instructions and reminders are separated from the surroundings. For 
    example, when you want to leave a group, there is a big box in the bottom of the page to show users the information
    they need. And even when users did something wrong, the remind label will appear in the most conspicuous area.
    
    In our app, due to the lack of techniques, we show all information with words. In the future, we can make different
    modes for redundant presentation of essential information. And also in the future, we can allow users to use this 
    app verbally like "siri".



    Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
    
    In our app, any mistakes made by user would not terminate the program but get a message returned to help users, and 
    those messages are always in the most conspicuous areas. For example, when the user wnat to create account with the
    user name that is already created, we will remind user under the box where they fill in the user name in stead of 
    reaturning "user created" to mislead users. 

    However, when the user terminate the program without saving the data in the first scene of our GUI. He will not be
    notified and there is no "auto save" functionality, so he will failed to save his changes. In the future, we can 
    make auto save feature that save the data right after the user did any change like creating an acoount or creating 
    a group
    


    Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
    
    In our project, due to the lack of time, we didn't do very well on this. In the future, when users are creating the
    task, they will no need to type in "Yes" or "No" for whether or not they need to set a timer. There will be a check 
    box for the decision of the timer, and if the box is checked, the textarea for user to set a time will appear.

    Also, in the future, we will allow users to access their group content directly when they create a new group, that
    is, when they succeefully create a group, they don't need to croos the window, click view group button, and choose
    the group name of the group they just created to access the group content.

    Again, auto save feature of the user data can be applied in the future so that users don't need to save their data
    manually in the first page of GUI.

    Last but not least, the auto complete option for text can be applied in the future when the user want to leave 
    message in the group chat box.


    
    Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use

    In our app, especially in the login page, the high contrast color is implemented from the options and the background
    If we have time, we can add pictures in the background to other scenes to make high contrast color for users.
    Also,  we tried our best make our text larges enough and options clear enough for staneded or seated users. And we 
    limited the infomation showing in each page so that users would be alble to know which page is referenced to which
    functionality of our project.

    We ignored "Accommodate variations in hand and grip size." because it is not application in the computer that
    users don't physically "grab" things, they are using touch pad or mouse to manipulate our app.


2.Write a paragraph about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to 
customers. This could be a specific category such as "students" or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to 
give a bit more detail along with the category.

    We would market our program toward companies, schools, and students. Professors and CEO from a school or company 
    can use our app to assign tasks to their students or employees. The message box in our group functionality can help 
    students or employees to communicate under professors' or CEOs' supervise. Also, students can use our app to make 
    plans to their life and get self-deciplined. Also, students can form study group and interact with others to boost
    their grade! Also, our program is open for any individual who would like to use an app to plan for their life as 
    well as interact with other individules in the grooup. 

3.Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. For example, 
a program that converts txt files to files that can be printed by a braille printer are less likely to be used by 
people who do not read braille.

    Our program is less likely to be used by people who can't speak English because all instructions are in English.
    Also, this program cannot be manipulated verablly (like siri), so people with seeing disablity would not likely use 
    our program. Also, apparantly, people who don't use computer would not use our program, because our program can 
    only be accessed from the computer. Last but not least, people who don't have plans and don't want to interact with
    others would less likely to use our program, because our program is aiming for provide a platform for users to make
    plans and interact with other users.
